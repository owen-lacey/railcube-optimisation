title: Lighting & Shadows
description: Directional, ambient, and point lights; baked vs dynamic shading; and colored cast shadows.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import PolyDemo from '../../../components/PolyDemo.astro';

PolyCSS shades each polygon with a Lambert model that matches three.js's `MeshLambertMaterial`. A scene takes **one directional light, one ambient light, and any number of point lights**, set on `<poly-scene>` / `PolyScene` / `createPolyScene()`. Shading happens either once on the CPU (**baked**) or live in CSS `calc()` (**dynamic**) — see [Lighting modes](#lighting-modes).

The light types are documented in the [Core Types reference](/api/types/#polydirectionallight); this guide is the conceptual tour.

## The light sources

### Directional light

One infinitely-distant light with a single `direction`, `color`, and `intensity` — like the sun. Every surface gets `color · intensity · max(0, n · L̂)`.

<PolyDemo
  id="lighting-directional"
  generator="cube"
  generatorParams='{"radius":14}'
  shadow
  controls='["lightYaw","lightPitch","lightIntensity","ambient"]'
  defaults='{"rotX":58,"rotY":35,"zoom":0.1,"light":{"intensity":4.5,"ambient":0.4}}'
/>

Drag **light °** / **light ↑** to move the sun and watch the lit side — and the cast shadow on the ground — follow; **intensity** and **ambient** control brightness and fill.

### Ambient light

A uniform fill with `color` and `intensity` (default `0.4`) added to every surface regardless of orientation. Use it to lift shadowed faces out of pure black — exactly what a shadowed region fades toward.

### Point lights

Positional lights given as an array. Each has a world-space `position`, `color`, `intensity`, and optional `castShadow`. Point lights are **direction-only** — there is **no distance falloff** (they emulate three.js's `PointLight(distance: 0, decay: 0)`); a surface is lit by `color · intensity · max(0, n · L̂)` where `L̂` points from the surface to the light. Shading is flat per face — an accepted approximation of three.js's per-fragment gradient, exact for small faces or distant lights.

> **Point lights are baked-mode only.** Dynamic mode's zero-JS light updates can't express a per-face direction that varies with position, so dynamic scenes ignore `pointLights` entirely (shading *and* shadows). See [Lighting modes](#lighting-modes).

## Lighting modes

`textureLighting` (scene-level, with a per-mesh override) chooses **how** the Lambert result is applied:

| | **`"baked"`** (default) | **`"dynamic"`** |
|---|---|---|
| How | Computed once on the CPU, written into each leaf's color / atlas pixels | Resolved live in CSS `calc()` from scene-root variables + per-leaf normals |
| Point lights | ✅ Supported | ❌ Ignored (direction-only CSS can't vary per position) |
| Moving the directional light | Re-bake needed for the lit surface (shadows update for free) | **Zero JS** — just updates a CSS variable |
| Best for | Static scenes, point lights, exact color | Live / animated directional light, interactive light dragging |

Rule of thumb: **dynamic** when the directional light moves every frame; **baked** when you want point lights or the lights are mostly static.

## Cast shadows

Shadows are CPU-projected SVG surfaces (not a render-strategy leaf). Mark casters with `castShadow` and receivers with `receiveShadow`:

<Tabs syncKey="fw">
<TabItem label="Vanilla JS">
```js
scene.add(parsedFloor, { receiveShadow: true });
scene.add(parsedModel, { castShadow: true });
scene.setOptions({ shadow: { color: "#000000", opacity: 0.3, lift: 0.02 } });
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="React">
```tsx
<PolyScene shadow={{ color: "#000000", opacity: 0.3, lift: 0.02 }}>
  <PolyGround size={8} color="#d8d2c7" receiveShadow />
  <PolyMesh src="/model.glb" castShadow />
</PolyScene>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Vue">
```vue
<PolyScene :shadow="{ color: '#000000', opacity: 0.3, lift: 0.02 }">
  <PolyGround :size="8" color="#d8d2c7" receive-shadow />
  <PolyMesh src="/model.glb" cast-shadow />
</PolyScene>
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

What to expect:

- **Directional shadows** work in both lighting modes and only appear for a directional light with `intensity > 0` (intensity `0`, or no directional light, casts nothing — matching three.js).
- **Point-light shadows** are baked-mode only and **radial** (each vertex projects along its own ray from the light). Set `castShadow: true` on the point light *and* `castShadow`/`receiveShadow` on the meshes.
- **Colored multi-light shadows.** Each light's shadow is filled with the receiver lit by every *other* light, so a spot blocked from one colored light still shows the others' color. Where two shadows overlap, the region composites to the both-blocked color (ambient only) — not a doubled-up black smear.
- **`shadow.lift`** floats the shadow a hair above the receiver to avoid z-fighting; the default is fine, just don't set it to exactly `0` on a coplanar floor.

## Parametric shadows

By default a shadow projects every casting polygon. Set `shadow: { parametric: true }` and PolyCSS instead casts one low-resolution **coverage silhouette** per caster — far fewer DOM/SVG vertices and a cheaper projection, at the cost of an approximate (but concave- and hole-aware) outline. The exact path stays the default; parametric is purely opt-in and works in all three renderers.

```js
// vanilla
scene.setOptions({ shadow: { parametric: true, definition: 32 } });
```

```jsx
// React
<PolyScene shadow={{ parametric: true, definition: 32 }}>
```

```vue
<!-- Vue -->
<PolyScene :shadow="{ parametric: true, definition: 32 }">
```

- **`definition`** (default `16`) — silhouette detail. Higher → closer to the exact outline and sharper holes, but more vertices. Override it per mesh with **`shadowDefinition`** (`PolyMeshTransform.shadowDefinition` in vanilla, `<PolyMesh shadowDefinition>` in React, `shadow-definition` in Vue) so a detailed hero caster stays crisp while simple props run cheap in the same scene.
- **`style: "vector" | "pixel"`** — `"vector"` (default) traces a smooth concave contour; `"pixel"` greedy-meshes the coverage into blocky **voxel** rectangles, where `definition` becomes the pixel-grid resolution (lower → chunkier). Holes (courtyards, an arena) come through in both.
- **Point lights** are supported — each casting point light gets its own radial silhouette.
- **`dragDefinition`** *(vanilla `createPolyScene` only)* — progressive refinement. While the directional light is being dragged the shadow renders at this lower definition for a smooth drag, then a debounced pass re-emits at full `definition` once the light settles. React/Vue get the same effect by lowering `definition` in component state during a drag.
- **`followAnimation`** — by default a deforming/animated caster's shadow **freezes** at the last pose (re-projecting it every frame is expensive). Set `followAnimation: true` to make the shadow track the animation; pair it with `parametric` + a modest `definition` so the per-frame reprojection stays cheap.

## Live & animated lights

- **Animating the directional light:** use **dynamic** mode — moving the light is a single CSS-variable write per frame, no JS in the paint loop, and shadows re-project automatically.
- **Baked mode + a light change:** cast shadows re-emit automatically (cheap SVG), but the baked *lit surface* stays frozen until you re-bake — call `mesh.rebakeAtlas()` (debounce it to the end of a drag; the atlas raster is the one costly step). The React/Vue components re-bake automatically on prop change, so this only applies to the imperative `createPolyScene()` API.
- **Animating point lights:** baked-mode only, so re-bake per change (or per debounced step). For continuously moving lights, prefer a single directional light in dynamic mode.
