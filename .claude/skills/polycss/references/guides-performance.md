PolyCSS renders meshes as real DOM elements: every visible polygon is an HTML leaf with a CSS transform. That gives you DevTools inspection, DOM events, and CSS styling on every polygon, but it means **performance scales with mounted element count and atlas area**. Understanding both is key to building smooth scenes.

## Live demo: polygon count vs. performance

The sphere below starts at subdivision level 3 (320 triangles). Bump subdivisions up to 4 (1,280) or 5 (5,120) and watch the frame rate drop. This illustrates how quadrupling the subdivision level quadruples the DOM node count: and rendering cost.

<PolyDemo
  id="perf-sphere-demo"
  generator="sphere"
  generatorParams='{"subdivisions":2,"radius":15}'
  controls='["subdivisions","radius","zoom","rotX","rotY","animate"]'
  defaults='{"rotX":65,"rotY":45,"zoom":0.15,"animate":true}'
  showStats
/>

## Polygon count matters

The dominant cost in PolyCSS is usually browser work over the DOM tree: style, layout, paint, and compositing over many transformed leaves. Camera and mesh motion are expressed as ancestor transforms where possible, so the hot path avoids per-polygon JavaScript, but the browser still has to process every mounted leaf.

Confirmed during benchmarking on a 10k-triangle mesh with auto-rotate:
- **Scripting**: ~579ms / 7s (mostly React re-renders)
- **Rendering (style recalc + layout)**: ~2,130ms / 7s: the dominant cost

## Automatic mesh optimization

PolyCSS automatically optimizes loaded meshes before rendering. The default `meshResolution: "lossy"` path bakes solid texture swatches, merges visually redundant baked swatch colors, tries static triangle simplification for eligible non-animated imports, merges compatible polygons, and can use bounded geometric approximation when that lowers estimated DOM render cost. Wider lossy candidates are gated by whole-mesh seam diagnostics and a minimum render-cost win. `meshResolution: "lossless"` keeps exact planar candidates only.

This is most useful for architectural meshes with large flat surfaces: walls, floors, ceilings, voxel faces, and other areas where many same-material triangles can collapse without visual change.

**Limitations:**
- Per-polygon DOM addressing is lost for merged groups.
- UV-textured polygons only merge when texture mapping can be preserved. Lossless mode requires exact coplanarity; lossy mode may project near-coplanar textured neighbors into one atlas sprite within the configured displacement budget.
- Per-polygon DOM addressing is not available inside a merged flat region.

## Render strategies

Simple polygons are cheaper than textured or irregular polygons. The renderer uses CSS primitives where possible:

- Axis-aligned rectangles and stable quads use solid `<b>` leaves.
- Solid triangles and exact corner-shape solids use `<u>` leaves when supported.
- Other supported solid clipped polygons use `<i>` leaves.
- Textured polygons and fallbacks use atlas `<s>` leaves.
- Cast shadows use SVG shadow surfaces for meshes with `castShadow`; light changes reproject the path without atlas redraw.

Use `collectPolyRenderStats(root)` to inspect the mounted leaf mix. For diagnostics, `strategies={{ disable: ["b", "i", "u"] }}` forces fallback atlas rendering so you can compare output or isolate browser compositor bugs.

## Voxel fast paths

Voxel-shaped meshes are special. Generic voxel-shaped polygon meshes can mount only camera-facing normals and patch the mounted set as the camera or mesh rotation crosses a face boundary. Raw `.vox` sources also preserve `voxelSource`; eligible baked-mode meshes in vanilla, React, and Vue render visible voxel quads directly as `<b>` leaves inside face wrappers. Dynamic lighting, shadows, animation, non-exact voxel geometry, or geometry replaced via `setPolygons()` fall back to the polygon renderer.

## `targetSize` and polygon count

Use `targetSize` when parsing to keep models at a predictable world-space scale. This does not decimate the source mesh by itself, but it affects how large the generated DOM geometry and atlas footprints are. For real element-count reduction, rely on automatic coplanar merge, interior culling, or lower-poly source assets.

```ts
// Vanilla imperative loading
const result = await loadMesh("/castle.obj", {
  objOptions: { targetSize: 30 },
});
```

```tsx
// React
<PolyMesh src="/castle.obj" parseOptions={{ objOptions: { targetSize: 30 } }} />
<PolyMesh src="/castle.obj" parseOptions={{ objOptions: { targetSize: 80 } }} />
```

## `textureQuality` and texture memory

Generated atlas pages default to `textureQuality="auto"`. Auto starts from the packed atlas area, caps oversized runtime bitmaps by page side length and decoded-memory budget, and chooses the fixed CSS sprite size used by atlas leaves. Desktop-class auto uses a 128px sprite to avoid Safari/Firefox compositor flattening artifacts; mobile-class auto and explicit numeric quality use 64px to keep layer memory lower.

```html
<!-- Vanilla -->
<poly-camera rot-x="65" rot-y="45">
  <poly-scene texture-quality="0.5">
    <poly-mesh src="/model.glb"></poly-mesh>
  </poly-scene>
</poly-camera>
```

```tsx
// React
<PolyCamera>
  <PolyScene textureQuality={0.5}>
    <PolyMesh src="/model.glb" />
  </PolyScene>
</PolyCamera>

// Or per mesh:
<PolyMesh src="/model.glb" textureQuality={0.5} />
```

Use explicit numeric values when you want to override auto raster scale: `0.5` or `0.75` for distant or dense assets, `1` for close-up inspection when the runtime bitmap cost is acceptable. Numeric quality keeps the 64px atlas sprite size.

## Atlas and Blob URL Lifecycle

UV-textured polygons share generated atlas blob URLs (created during the canvas rasterization pass at mount). These are revoked on unmount. Keep these rules in mind:

- Textured meshes do a one-time atlas generation pass at mount; very large texture footprints can still cost memory and startup time.
- `solidTextureSamples` can convert uniform texture swatches into solid-color polygons before optimization, avoiding unnecessary atlas slices for low-poly assets that use a texture atlas as a color palette.
- Call `dispose()` on `ParseResult` (or `usePolyMesh` result) when you've loaded the mesh imperatively.
- The mesh element (`<poly-mesh>` / `<PolyMesh>`) handles disposal automatically on unmount or `src` change.
