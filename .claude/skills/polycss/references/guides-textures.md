description: Loading OBJ, STL, glTF, GLB, and VOX meshes into PolyCSS with UV textures and material colors.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import PolyDemo from '../../../components/PolyDemo.astro';

PolyCSS loads 3D mesh files (OBJ, STL, glTF, GLB, and MagicaVoxel VOX) and renders them as DOM elements. UV textures are extracted from OBJ/glTF/GLB files and packed into generated atlas pages; STL imports are triangle meshes with optional binary Magics face colors, but no standard units, textures, UVs, or hierarchy.

## Live demo: UV-textured OBJ

The broken stone slab below uses `stone.obj` with a companion `stone.mtl` file that points at `stone_low_Material_Diffuse.png`. Each UV-mapped face is a DOM sprite whose background is a generated atlas page.

<PolyDemo
  id="textures-stone-slab-demo"
  model="/gallery/obj/opengameart/broken-stone-slab/stone.obj"
  mtl="/gallery/obj/opengameart/broken-stone-slab/stone.mtl"
  controls='["zoom","rotX","rotY","animate","interactive"]'
  defaults='{"rotX":65,"rotY":45,"zoom":0.08,"interactive":true}'
/>

## Declarative loading: the mesh element

The simplest way to render a mesh is the mesh element with a `src`. It fetches the file, parses it, and renders one polygon element per polygon automatically.

## Supported formats

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| OBJ + MTL | `.obj` + `.mtl` | Text format. UV maps via `vt`. Material textures from `map_Kd`. |
| STL | `.stl` | ASCII or binary triangle mesh. Supports binary Magics face colors; STL has no standard units, textures, UVs, or hierarchy. |
| glTF | `.gltf` | JSON format. Embedded or external buffers. TEXCOORD_0 UVs. |
| GLB | `.glb` | Binary glTF. Embedded textures extracted as blob URLs. |
| MagicaVoxel | `.vox` | Voxel format. Exposed faces become colored polygon quads; eligible vanilla, React, and Vue meshes use a baked direct-voxel fast path. |

## OBJ with MTL

When your OBJ has a companion MTL file with textures, PolyCSS reads `map_Kd` entries and applies them as UV-mapped textures. Pass the `mtl` attribute / prop:

```html
<!-- Vanilla -->
<poly-mesh src="/rock.obj" mtl="/rock.mtl"></poly-mesh>
```

```tsx
// React
<PolyMesh
  src="/rock.obj"
  mtl="/rock.mtl"
  parseOptions={{ objOptions: { targetSize: 40 } }}
/>
```

## Material overrides

Override material colors or textures without modifying the source files (React / Vue prop form):

```tsx
<PolyMesh
  src="/character.obj"
  parseOptions={{
    objOptions: {
      materialColors: { Skin: "#f4c2a1" },
      materialTextures: { Body: "/body-diffuse.png" },
      includeObjects: ["Body", "Head"],  // only these objects
    },
  }}
/>
```

For glTF/GLB files that preserved UVs but lost an external image reference, use the same material-name texture override under `gltfOptions`:

```tsx
<PolyMesh
  src="/character.glb"
  parseOptions={{
    gltfOptions: {
      materialTextures: { Texture: "/character-atlas.png" },
    },
  }}
/>
```

## Imperative loading

For programmatic loading with explicit lifecycle, use `loadMesh` from the core parser. This is the universal vanilla path; React adds a `usePolyMesh` hook on top:

```ts
// Vanilla: works anywhere, no framework
import { createPolyCamera, loadMesh, createPolyScene } from "@layoutit/polycss";

const result = await loadMesh("https://polycss.com/gallery/obj/cottage.obj", {
  mtlUrl: "https://polycss.com/gallery/obj/cottage.mtl",
  gltfOptions: { targetSize: 60 },
});
const camera = createPolyCamera({ rotX: 65, rotY: 45 });
const scene = createPolyScene(document.getElementById("host")!, { camera });
scene.add(result);
// later:
scene.destroy(); // removes the scene and disposes registered meshes
```

```tsx
// React: usePolyMesh wraps loadMesh + dispose() on unmount
import { PolyCamera, PolyScene, Poly, usePolyMesh } from "@layoutit/polycss-react";

function Viewer() {
  const { polygons, loading, error } = usePolyMesh("https://polycss.com/gallery/obj/cottage.obj", {
    mtlUrl: "https://polycss.com/gallery/obj/cottage.mtl",
  });

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error}</div>;

  return (
    <PolyCamera>
      <PolyScene>
        {polygons.map((p, i) => <Poly key={i} {...p} />)}
      </PolyScene>
    </PolyCamera>
  );
}
```

## Atlas pipeline

For textured polygons, PolyCSS runs a one-time atlas canvas pass at mount. Flat-color polygons can bypass the atlas when they can render as CSS solids or `border-shape` polygons.

1. Extract the texture image from the file (or fetch it by URL) when the polygon has a texture.
2. Solve a 6-DOF affine transform from the polygon's UV coordinates to its 2D screen footprint when UVs are available.
3. Pack polygon footprints into one or more atlas pages.
4. Clip, draw texture pixels or shaded color fills, and export atlas pages to blob URLs via `canvas.toBlob()`. `textureQuality="auto"` can rasterize these pages below full CSS resolution when packed pages would create oversized runtime bitmaps, and also selects the atlas leaf sprite size used for CSS compositing.
5. Repair antialiased atlas pixels along shared textured edges, then render each polygon as an `<s>` with `background-image`, `background-size`, and `background-position`.

Generated atlas blob URLs are revoked on unmount (call `dispose()` or let `PolyMesh` / `usePolyMesh` handle it).

## Tips

- **`targetSize`**: scale the model so its longest axis fits this many world units (default: `60`). `.vox` models snap to the nearest integer voxel CSS cell size, so the final size may differ slightly to keep voxel fast-path coordinates integral.
- **`paletteMergeDistance` / `colorRegionMergeDistance`**: for `.vox` files with noisy palettes, fold nearby opaque, hue-compatible colors before greedy meshing and optionally clean up small local color islands/streaks. These are lossy and change authored colors, but can reduce material count and split-quad output. In the gallery and builder, the Mesh resolution control applies them only in `Lossy` mode; `Lossless` keeps the authored palette exact.
- **`solidTextureSamples`**: when enabled through `loadMesh`, texture-backed faces whose sampled UV region is effectively one color are converted to solid-color polygons before optimization. This avoids atlas slices for assets that use texture images as color swatches.
- In the gallery and builder, Mesh resolution `Lossy` also collapses nearby colors produced by solid texture sampling on OBJ/GLB assets before mesh optimization. `Lossless` keeps those sampled colors exact.
- **`textureQuality`**: leave at `"auto"` for workload-based bitmap caps and browser/device sprite sizing, or set a numeric raster scale for explicit quality. `0.5` uses about one quarter of the atlas bitmap memory of `1`.
- Shared textured edges are repaired automatically during atlas generation. Geometry stays unchanged; only low-alpha atlas pixels at those shared edges are filled from nearby opaque texels.
- **`baseUrl`**: for OBJ/glTF files with external texture paths, pass the file's URL so relative paths resolve correctly.
- For large meshes: blob URLs for embedded textures and generated atlases are revoked when `dispose()` is called. Always let PolyCSS manage this: don't hold references to blob URLs across remounts.
