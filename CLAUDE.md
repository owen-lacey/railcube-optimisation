# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this project is

Optimising track layouts for **Rail Cube**, a children's magnetic monorail toy: cube blocks click together into 3D tracks and a mini train runs along them (including up walls and upside down). The deliverable is a blog post that builds up a constraint model incrementally — starting simple, then slowly adding constraints and objectives.

## Ground rules

- **This is a learning exercise for Owen.** Do not prescribe the modelling or build ahead of his direction. Answer what's asked, flag genuine contradictions or knock-on effects, and let him drive the design decisions.
- **Accessible vocabulary only.** Directions are up/down, left/right, forwards/backwards — never x/y/z coordinates. The frame is **fixed from the viewer's perspective** (not train-relative), matching the isometric layout used for visualisations.

## Known hard constraints

- The track must end where it begins (closed loop).
- No collisions between pieces.

## Visualisation: PolyCSS

Track layouts and the train are rendered with [PolyCSS](https://polycss.com) (`@layoutit/polycss`), a CSS 3D engine that renders meshes as real DOM elements. Use the `polycss` skill (`.claude/skills/polycss/`) when touching visualisation code — it has the API cheat-sheet, verified gotchas where the official docs are wrong, and the full docs mirrored offline. A working example lives at `spikes/polycss/index.html`.

## Solver: cpsat-js

Optimisation uses [cpsat-js](https://github.com/owen-lacey/cpsat-js) — Owen's own WebAssembly port of Google OR-Tools' CP-SAT solver (npm `cpsat-js`). It runs in browser and Node with zero native dependencies, and can be tweaked if this project needs features it lacks.

Key API: `CpSolver.create()` (async), `CpModel` with `newIntVar`/`newBoolVar`/`newIntervalVar`, fluent expressions (`x.plus(y).le(10)`), `addAllDifferent`, `addBoolOr`/`addBoolAnd`, `addNoOverlap`, `addCircuit`, `minimize`/`maximize`, `.onlyEnforceIf(literal)`.

Vite gotcha: add `cpsat-js` to `optimizeDeps.exclude`, otherwise esbuild pre-bundling breaks the WASM URL resolution in dev.
